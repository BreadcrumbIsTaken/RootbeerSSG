## Running on your machine üíª:
The recommended way to install Rootbeer is to make a Virtual Envrionment. You will need a package called `venv`
If you don't have the `venv` module, you can install it like this:

You can do so by putting this in your console:
```shell
python -m venv env
```
and it will create a folder called `env`. You can call it whatever you want.
Now to activate it, in your console run
```shell
env\Scripts\activate
```
if you are on Windows.
Great! You have your virtual environment!
If you want to deactivate the virtual environment, just run
```shell
deactivate
