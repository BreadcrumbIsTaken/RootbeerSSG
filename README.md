# What is RootbeerSSG? ü§î

RootbeerSSG (or Rootbeer as I call it 100% of the time) is a <abbr title="Static Site Generator">SSG</abbr> that specilises in making static blogs.

# How to download Rootbeer üîª

It's easy!

All you have to do is open a terminal and put this line into it:
```bash
pip install rootbeer
```
Or
```bash
python -m pip install rootbeer
```
Or
```bash
python3 -m pip install rootbeer
```

## Running on your machine üíª:
The recommended way to install Rootbeer is to make a Virtual Envrionment. You will need a package called `venv`
If you don't have the `venv` module, you can install it like this:
```shell
pip install venv
```
You can do so by putting this in your console:
```shell
python -m venv env
```
and it will create a folder called `env`. You can call it whatever you want.
Now to activate it, in your console run
```shell
env\Scripts\activate
```
if you are on Windows.

Great! You have your virtual environment!
Now all you have to do is install the dependincies.
Do
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and it should install all requirements.
Now to compile everything, run:
```shell
python rootbeer.py
```
And you did it!
If you want to deactivate the virtual environment, just run
```shell
deactivate
```
